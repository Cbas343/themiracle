        In general, reported Eucharistic miracles usually consist of unexplainable phenomena
        such as consecrated hosts visibly transforming into myocardium tissue, being
        preserved for extremely long stretches of time, surviving being thrown into fire,
        bleeding, or even sustaining people for decades. Some of them are:

              In the city of Lanciano, Italy, then known as Anxanum, some time in the 700s, a Basilian
              hieromonk was assigned to celebrate Mass at the Monastery of St. Longinus. Celebrating in
              the Roman rite and using unleavened bread, the monk had doubts about the Catholic doctrine
              of the real presence. During the Mass, when he said the words of consecration ("This is my
              body; this is my blood"), the priest saw the bread change into living flesh and the wine
              change into blood which coagulated into five globules, of different shapes and sizes.

              In 1263, a German priest known as Peter of Prague was struggling with the doctrine of
              transubstantiation. While he was saying Mass in Bolseno, Italy, blood began to stream out
              of the host and onto the corporal at the moment of consecration. This was reported to and
              investigated by Pope Urban IV, who concluded that the miracle was real. The bloodstained
              linen is still exhibited at the cathedral in Orvieto, Italy. Many eucharistic miracles are
              like the one experienced by Peter of Prague, in which the host turns into flesh and blood.

              A woman living in Santarém, Portugal, in the 13th century was distressed that her husband was
              unfaithful to her and she decided to consult a sorceress for help. The sorceress told her
              the price of her services was a consecrated host. She went to Mass at The Church of St.
              Stephen and received the Eucharist on her tongue, removed the Eucharist from her mouth,
              wrapped it in her veil, and headed to the door of the church. But before she got out, the
              host began to bleed. When she got home, she put the bloodied host in a trunk. That night,
              a miraculous light emanated from the trunk. She repented of what she had done and the next
              morning confessed to her priest. Her priest came and retrieved the host and took it back
              to the church. After an investigation and approval of the miracle, the church was renamed
              Church of the Holy Miracle, and the bloodied host remains on display to this day.

              In Buenos Aires, Argentina, on the feast of the Assumption in 1996, a host fell to the
              ground during the distribution of Communion and was placed in a container with water to
              dissolve. Ten days later it had transformed into blood. This was one of three Eucharistic
              miracles that occurred in the small church of St. Mary's in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in the
              years 1992, 1994, and 1996. All three happened under the leadership of Auxiliary Bishop
              Jorge Bergoglio, now Pope Francis.

              On April 28th, 2001, there was Eucharistic adoration at St. Mary’s parish in
              Chirattakonam, India, when suddenly three red stains materialized on the host. The priest
              didn’t know what to do and placed the host back into the tabernacle. A few days later he
              retrieved the host to examine it again, and the red stains had arranged themselves to look
              like the face of a man (Jesus?). He quickly found a photographer and had pictures taken of
              the host.
