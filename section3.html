                    <i>The Last Supper.</i> While they were eating he took bread, and after he had
                    pronounced the blessing, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “Take it; this is my body.”
                    Then he took a cup, and after offering thanks he gave it to them. After they all drank from it,
                    he said to them, “This is my blood of the covenant, which will be shed on behalf of many...

                <li><b>Luke 22, 19-20:</b>
                    <i>Jesus Gives His Body and His Blood.</i> Then he took bread, and after giving thanks he broke
                    it and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body, which will be given for you. Do this in memory
                    of me.” And he did the same with the cup after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant
                    in my blood, which will be poured out for you.

                <li><b>John 6, 35:</b>
                    Jesus answered them,“I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry, and
                    whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.

                <li><b>John 6, 51:</b>
                    I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever; and
                    the bread that I will give is my flesh, for the life of the world.”

                <br>
                <li><b>John 6, 53-57:</b>
                    Jesus said to them, “Amen, amen, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and
                    drink his blood, you do not have life within you. Whoever feeds upon my flesh and drinks my
                    blood has eternal life,and I will raise him up on the last day. For my flesh is real food, and
                    my blood is real drink. “Whoever feeds upon my flesh and drinks my blood dwells in me and I
                    dwell in him. Just as the living Father sent me and I have life because of the Father, so
                    whoever feeds upon me will live because of me.

                <li><b>1 Corinthians 11, 27-30:</b>
                    Therefore, anyone who eats the bread and drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner is
                    guilty of an offense against the body and blood of the Lord. Everyone should examine himself
                    about eating the bread and drinking from the cup. For a person who eats and drinks without
                    discerning the body of the Lord is eating and drinking judgment on himself. That is why many of
                    you are weak and ill, and a number of you have fallen asleep.
